### Git workflow

fork the repo on github

clone the repo from the forked copy

    $ git remote -v

    origin	https://github.com/<UserName>/nextstep.git (fetch)
    origin	https://github.com/<UserName>/nextstep.git (push)

    $ git remote add upstream git@github.com:xChristianZx/nextstep.git
    $ git remote -v

    origin	https://github.com/<UserName>/nextstep.git (fetch)
    origin	https://github.com/<UserName>/nextstep.git (push)
    upstream	git@github.com:xChristianZx/nextstep.git (fetch)
    upstream	git@github.com:xChristianZx/nextstep.git (push)

do the following from master

    git fetch upstream
    git checkout -b development upstream/development

create new branch to work off of
    git checkout -b <branchType>/<branch name>

    // branchtype examples

    setup/<branch name>
    feature/
    bug/
    style/
    refactor/

rebase and push your changes to your forked repo
    while in new branch...
    git fetch upstream
    git rebase upstream/development
    git push -u origin <branch_name>
    create the pr via your fork

alternatively if you are collaborator you may push your new branch directly to the primary repo and pr from there
    while in new branch...
    git fetch upstream
    git rebase upstream/development
    git push -u upstream <branch_name>
    request branch pr

sometimes pr will still need rebase or merge resolution - in that case follow these directions
https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/How-to-Rebase-a-Pull-Request
tldr; checkout locally then rebase followed by force push

for all pull requests, prefer squashing commits unless its a large pr

Happy coding!
